Welcome everyone! This is my first news big iOS mobile application. I decided to make a news app where I obtained a free news api fron www.newsapi.com. This api posts real news articles that I can show to my users, so they are able to stay up to date on the latest news. The key functionalities in my app are allowing users to bookmark stories (even if he app is restarted the stories will still be bookmarked), refreshing the app to check for newly posted stories, allows users to view article in safari using webview, has search functionality to let users search news stories, has customizable categories to let users filter the type of data they want to read about and more!
